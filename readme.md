# nixcfg

**Doesn't yet work** (at least for me); turns out nixos' configuration
is...let's just say "less than easy". Or consistent. Or stable. Or...well,
you get the idea.

Dumping this here so I can iterate on it over time and keep track of what
I change so as to track down the weird, undefined, unexplained and unlogged
"boom" that happens like...constantly.
